# Design Proess
As I was crafting the design for this website, my primary focus was to ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience for my users, coupled with an appealing visual aesthetic. To achieve this, I drew inspiration from established bag brands such as Good Totes and Paper Bunny, meticulously studying the features that resonated with me as a user. By distilling the essence of their websites, I aimed to incorporate functionalities that not only enhance user interaction but also elevate the overall aesthetic of 'The Ronans.'
